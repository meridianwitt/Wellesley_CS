    <h1>Achieving Course Goals</h1>
    <p>I am proud to say that I am confident that I have met all the course learning goals for CS 249. However, because creating web mashups is such a huge field, I am excited that there is so much room to improve. Over the summer, I look forward to improving the AMs I have created and creating more.  </p>
<p>This class has given me the confidence to explore new technologies and review once that I’ve learned from other classes. I really loved the collaborative “hacker” mentality of the class. I believe my general skills in perseverance, hacking, and collaboration will be quite useful.
CS 249 definitely my favorite CS class I have ever taken. I hope to take my confidence here back to my study and review of other core tenants of programming.  I did not have a clear goal when entering the class other than satisfying a major requirement. Although I have a media sciences concentration, I feel an incredible need to practice programming and build up a portfolio. This class has turned out to be a great start. Inspired by all of the mashups for the class, I have plenty ideas of apps to great and beginnings of ways to create them. With knowledge of Java and web, I can start more intensive work on Android native app creation and more web mashups.</p>
<p>If I were to take this course again, I would have definitely planned more on the front and backend.  Creating even basic mockups and list of functionalities before coding, I could have improved my applications’ interfaces and functionality.</p> 
<p>I would love to see CS 249 again with a more solid schedule with the increased use of the “spaced recall” method. I loved that I am still using what I learned in the beginning of the course now, but I do feel that there is a way to consistently practice and use what we learned throughout the course often. I would definitely keep the hacker mentality and putting the onus on students to learn and increase the number of code reviews. 
This course was a game-changer for me. I hope it has been for others as well. </p>
