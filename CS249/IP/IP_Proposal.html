<h3>App Title:</h3> <p>Laidback Music (entertainment app)</p>

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>With Spotify and Echonest APIs, I want to create a music streaming app with not more nuanced radio creation capability but edit it with ease. You can save your preferences in an account (and possibly the playlists as well in MongoDB) and change the stream by not only by genre/artist/song, but also by acoustic attributes like dancability, energy, BPM, valence, and more.  The point of the playlist is to make it quickly and edit well and with ease. I will visualize the users’ preferences and compare them with other user preferences.</p>  

<h3>Need:</h3>
    <p>Spotify as the king in the web app music streaming game, there is space and a need for personalizing the music stream. Usually you only have the stream based on an artist or genre and the stream can be edited only according to likes (which force the app to guess what the user wants). I don’t seek to perfect streaming but using the power of Spotify and the amazing music filtering of Echonest, I want to make a better user interface for streaming more personalized and filtered radio.</p>

<h3>Possible Problems:</h3>
<p>I wonder how much information I will get about the radio that is created (the songs in the queue or the network of related artists being pulled from). If a lot is abstracted away, I will only be able to visualize the comparison of all user preferences.</p>
