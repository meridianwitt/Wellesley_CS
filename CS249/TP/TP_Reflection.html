    <h1>Team Project Reflection</h1>
    <p>I have not watched a video of myself presenting since I was in high school. Back then, I saw that I masked my nervousness with informality (slouching, informal tone, and a lot of gesturing). Now, I see that I was still nervous but I channeled the nervousness into fidgeting, holding my arms and hand, and saying a few likes and ums. </p>
    
<p>However, my team did really well all together. Our pace was brisk, but quick enough to allow plenty of great questions at the end. Our transitions could have been smoother with practice, but the presentation was cohesive and well-thought out. All of us made good eye contact with various members of the audiences, but I think all of us could have projected more and spoken more loudly. </p>

<p>If I were to give the presentation again, I would have a full demo of the application and insert statistics about health and wellness on college campuses and Wellesley specifically. I would also have a mockup that showed our plans for future directions.</p>

<p>Overall, the presentation reminded me that practice makes perfect!</p>
