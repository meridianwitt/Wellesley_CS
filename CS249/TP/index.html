        <h1> TP - Bounce</h1>
        
        <h2> By Meridian Witt, Sophia Zachares, and Chimuanya Okoro</h2>
        
        <p>Our app is called Bounce. It is meant to help people find exercise partners on Wellesley's campus in real time. The app will encourage people to exercise by creating social incentives. The way the app works is through two modes - when you are logged-in or not. When you are logged in you can create exercise events. If you are not logged-in then you can only see the exercise events (this is also true for the logged in user). In addition, when you are not logged in, you can filter the exercise events list by location and activity.</p>

        Breakdown of tasks:<br>
            <li>All: Attended and participated in brainstorming sessions to come up with the idea and basic structure of the application. </li>
            <li>Meridian: Meridian provided the team with her am6 code as a starting point. In the prototyping phase, she created the paper prototype for class so we would think about future interactions and explain our vision to other teams. She worked a bit with boot-strap and different css elements (with many plans for future directions). She also switched out the GoogleAccounts for Account-Password, deployed the application, and created the structure of our presentation.</li>
            <li>Sophia: Figured out the filtering function for the different buttons. Sophia added different screen-shots to our presentation.</li>
            <li>Chimuanya: Figured out Google accounts.</li></p>
        
        <p>Most of the time we worked on the project while we were all together. The exception of this was when Chimuanya figured out the google accounts, when Sophia figured out the sorting funcitonality of the filters, and when Meridian implimented boot-strap and css and deployed the app. However, there was always a meeting before or after to discuss all our changes.</p>
