Goal: Javascript code for implementing a wep app that searches the ABC API for Y,
and displays the results dynamically in a web page.

Honor Code Statement:
On this task I collaborated with Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. I had 
difficulty with the XXX issue, but Hermione gave me a good example to 
understand it. All the code in these files was typed by me.
